# RLE-Compression

This was an assignment for Seng 265.

RLE.c takes a text file for input and a 'e' or 'd' for encoding for decoding respectively. The string of text for encoding should be in the from of a DNA strand(eg., GGGGGGTTTTTAAAAAGGGAAAAAATTTGGGTTTTAAAAA) the ouput text will be a compressed string(eg., G6T5A5G3A6T3G3T4A5). Decoding takes the compressed string(eg., G6T5A5G3A6T3G3T4A5) and returns the original string in a text file.

The restrictions are the input string must be 40 characters or less.
