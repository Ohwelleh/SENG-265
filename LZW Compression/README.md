# LZW-Compression

This was an assignment for Seng 265 in which I had to create the LZW compression/decompression algorithm in C without the use of dynamic memory or data structures.

The program can take an image or text file in the command line and compress it to a .LZW file type. Then the program can take that same file and decompress it to get the original file back.
